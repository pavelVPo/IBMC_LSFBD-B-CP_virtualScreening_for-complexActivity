-23.94894945	1528530	Radioligand Competition Binding Assay: For the binding competition assay, 100 μL of Assay Buffer was added to all the wells of a 96 well GF/B filter plate (Millipore MultiScreen-HTS-FB cat# MSFBN6B50) for 10 minutes to pre-wet the filter prior to evacuation of the buffer (8 inches Hg for 8 seconds). To the pre-wet wells is added: 20 μL of Assay Buffer, 10 μL diluted test agent, 20 μL of a tritiated Smo antagonist (15 nM stock solution), and 50 μL of membrane preparation (40 μg total protein per well). The plates are sealed and mixed at room temperature for 5 min, incubated at room temperature for 2 hours, then washed 5 times with 100 μL/each of wash buffer and vacuum dried for 8 seconds at 8 inches Hg. The plate is then dried for one hour in a 60° C. oven prior to the addition of 45 μL of Microscint 20 (Packard, #6013621) to each well and incubation at RT for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The plate is counted in a TopCount scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer).			competitive binding	test

-17.88798127	1479012	GSK_TCAKS: pIC50 HepG2 human cell line viability assay using luminiscence. Actively growing HepG2 cells were removed from a T-175 TC flask using 5mL Eagle's MEM (containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and dispersed in the medium by repeated pipetting. Seeding density was checked to ensure that new mono-layers were not more than 50% confluent at the time of harvesting. Cell suspension was added to 500 mL of the same medium at a final density of 1.2 * 10^5 cells/mL. This cell suspension was dispensed (25 uL, 3000 cells per well) into 384-well clear-bottom plates using a Multidrop Combi dispenser. Prior to addition of the cell suspension, the screening compounds (250 nL) were pre-dispensed into the plates with an Echo liquid handler. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37C, 5% CO2. After incubation, plates equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min before proceeding to develop the luminescent signal. The signal developer, CellTiter-Glo Reagent, was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min and added to the plates (25uL per well) using a Multidrop Combi dispenser. Plates were left for 10 min at room temperature for stabilization and then read using a ViewLux.
